This project is aiming to replicate the convenience of music streaming platforms, but with more
control and ownership over what you listen to. In the world of streaming platforms, having ownership over your music and sharing it with
others is something of the past. Typically features like listening to music together are locked be-
hind a steep paywall if they are even offered at all. In this project, we are proposing a cloud based
solution to allow for local files to be uploaded to cloud storage, and shared via a group listen-
ing session.
